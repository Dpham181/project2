# Project 2: greedy versus exhaustive

Implement and compare two algorithms that solve the same problem. The first is a greedy algorithm with a fast (i.e. polynomial) running time, while the second is an exhaustive search algorithm with a slow (i.e. exponential) running time.

Both algorithms solve the problem of planning a high-protein diet. More specifically, given a set of many food items available to eat, these algorithms pick a subset of foods that fit within a given calorie budget while maximizing protein content.
